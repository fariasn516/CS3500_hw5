Overview:
We are trying to play the game ThreeTrios, which is a modification of the game Triple Triad.
Three Trios is a two-player game played on a regular grid of cells and custom cards.
Each player has a color: blue/red. And they each have a hand of cards.
When the game begins, both players are dealt an equal number of cards from a collection of cards.
The grid starts with no cards on it and will card cells and holes where cards cannot be placed.
There needs to be an odd number (n) card cells and an even number (n+1) of cards.
The red player goes first and when cards are placed down, they commence "battle" with one other
adjacent cards and the card with the higher value will "flip" the card with the lower value.
The game ends when all card cells are filled and the winner is who owns the most number of cards.
